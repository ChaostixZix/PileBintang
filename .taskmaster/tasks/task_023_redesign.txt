# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Data Export Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 20
# Priority: low
# Description: Allow users to export their complete journal data from Supabase in a common, accessible format.
# Details:
Develop a feature that enables users to export their entire journal data (posts, attachments metadata, pile structure) in a user-friendly format such as JSON or a collection of Markdown files. Consider using Supabase Functions to generate the export file server-side and store it temporarily in an `exports` storage bucket for download.

# Test Strategy:
Export data for users with varying amounts of content and attachments. Verify the exported data is complete, correctly formatted, and easily importable/readable. Test the download process.
