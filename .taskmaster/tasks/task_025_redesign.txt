# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Comprehensive End-to-End Test Plans [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design detailed test plans for all new cloud features, covering user stories, technical requirements, edge cases, and a full regression suite.
### Details:
Based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and implemented features (cloud sync, collaboration, data migration, error handling, etc.), create a comprehensive suite of end-to-end test cases. Include scenarios for successful operations, error conditions, edge cases, and a full regression test suite to ensure existing functionality is not broken.

## 2. Execute End-to-End & Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Perform the developed end-to-end and regression tests, log defects, and verify all success criteria are met.
### Details:
Execute the test plans developed in subtask 25.1. Document all test results, including passed, failed, and blocked tests. Log any defects found with detailed steps to reproduce, expected results, and actual results. Track defect resolution and retest fixes. Verify that all success criteria from the PRD are met.

## 3. Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) & Gather Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Organize and facilitate beta testing with a group of users to gather feedback on new cloud features and validate user experience.
### Details:
Recruit a diverse group of beta users. Prepare a UAT environment and provide clear instructions and scenarios. Conduct UAT sessions, collect qualitative and quantitative feedback through surveys, interviews, and direct observation. Analyze feedback to identify usability issues, bugs, and areas for improvement.

## 4. Draft User Documentation for Cloud Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create initial drafts of clear and concise user documentation, including guides for cloud sync, collaboration, data migration, and troubleshooting common issues.
### Details:
Write comprehensive guides covering how to enable and use cloud sync, share piles and manage collaborators, perform data migration, and troubleshoot common issues related to cloud features. Focus on clarity, conciseness, and user-friendliness, targeting the end-user perspective.

## 5. Review, Refine, and Finalize User Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3, 25.4
### Description: Conduct a thorough review of all drafted user documentation for accuracy, clarity, completeness, and incorporate feedback before final publication.
### Details:
Review the drafted documentation (from 25.4) against the implemented features and UAT feedback (from 25.3). Ensure all steps are accurate, screenshots are up-to-date, and language is consistent. Refine content based on clarity and completeness checks. Obtain final approval from product and technical leads. Publish the finalized documentation to the appropriate channels.
