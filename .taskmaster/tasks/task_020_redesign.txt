# Task ID: 20
# Title: Integrate Supabase Storage for Attachments
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure file upload, download, and management for attachments using Supabase Storage buckets.
# Details:
Create `pile-attachments` and `user-avatars` storage buckets in Supabase. Implement client-side logic for securely uploading images and other files, associating them with `posts` via the `attachments` table. Develop functionality to download and display these attachments. Configure RLS for storage buckets to ensure only authorized users can access files.

# Test Strategy:
Upload various file types and sizes. Verify successful upload, secure storage, and correct display/download. Test RLS by attempting to access unauthorized files.
