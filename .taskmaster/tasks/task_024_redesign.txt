# Task ID: 24
# Title: Performance Optimization & Load Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 18, 20, 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive performance testing, identify bottlenecks, and optimize database queries, real-time subscriptions, and sync logic.
# Details:
Perform load testing for concurrent users and large datasets to identify performance bottlenecks. Optimize SQL queries by adding necessary composite indexes and refining existing ones. Fine-tune real-time subscriptions and client-side sync logic to meet performance requirements (e.g., <2s sync latency, <500ms query response, <100ms real-time latency).

# Test Strategy:
Use profiling tools to identify slow queries. Conduct stress tests with simulated users. Monitor Supabase metrics for database performance. Verify all performance requirements are met under load.
