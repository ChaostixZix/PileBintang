# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Real-time Post Editing & Presence
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Supabase Realtime for live synchronization of post content, live cursor positions, and user presence within shared piles.
# Details:
Utilize `supabase.channel` to subscribe to `posts` changes within a specific pile for real-time content updates. Implement a mechanism for live cursor positions (e.g., using a dedicated presence channel or a temporary table). Develop UI to display presence indicators (who is currently online and viewing/editing a pile).

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time editing from multiple clients simultaneously. Verify cursor positions update accurately. Confirm presence indicators reflect active users in a pile.
