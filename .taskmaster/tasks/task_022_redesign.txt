# Task ID: 22
# Title: Develop Sync Status Indicators & Error Handling UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create clear visual indicators for sync status, connection status, and user-friendly error messages for sync-related issues.
# Details:
Implement UI elements (e.g., sidebar icons, status bar indicators) to visually communicate 'synced', 'syncing', 'offline', and 'conflict' states. Design and implement clear, actionable error messages and recovery options for network issues, sync failures, or data conflicts.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate various network conditions (offline, slow, intermittent). Verify UI indicators accurately reflect status. Trigger sync errors and confirm user-friendly error messages are displayed with guidance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Sync Status UI Elements & States [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the visual appearance, iconography, and placement for 'synced', 'syncing', 'offline', and 'conflict' states across various UI components.
### Details:
Create detailed mockups or wireframes specifying the visual representation (icons, colors, animations) for 'synced' (e.g., green checkmark), 'syncing' (e.g., spinning arrow), 'offline' (e.g., cloud with slash), and 'conflict' (e.g., warning triangle). Determine optimal placement for these indicators, such as a global status bar, sidebar icons, or specific pile/item indicators.

## 2. Implement Visual Sync Status Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Develop and integrate the UI components to display 'synced', 'syncing', 'offline', and 'conflict' states based on the approved design.
### Details:
Implement the actual UI elements (e.g., React components, CSS styles) for sidebar icons and status bar indicators. Integrate these components with the client-side sync infrastructure (Task 13) to subscribe to and react to real-time status changes (e.g., `syncService.onStatusChange('synced')`). Ensure smooth visual transitions between states.

## 3. Design User-Friendly Error Messages & Recovery Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the content, tone, and structure for user-facing error messages related to sync failures, network issues, and data conflicts, including actionable recovery options.
### Details:
Draft specific, concise, and empathetic error messages for common sync-related issues such as 'Network connection lost. Please check your internet connection and try again.', 'Sync failed: Server unavailable. We're working on it, please try again later.', 'Data conflict detected. Please review your changes or discard local edits.' For each error, define clear, actionable recovery steps and design the UI patterns (e.g., toast notifications, modal dialogs with buttons, inline alerts) for their presentation.

## 4. Implement Error Handling UI & Integration Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3
### Description: Develop the UI components to display the designed error messages and integrate the logic to trigger them based on sync-related events from the core infrastructure.
### Details:
Implement the UI components for displaying error messages (e.g., a global notification system, specific modal components). Integrate with the core sync infrastructure (Task 13) to listen for specific error events (e.g., `syncService.onError('network_offline')`, `syncService.onError('server_error')`, `syncService.onConflict(conflictDetails)`). Implement the logic to map these events to the appropriate designed error messages and display them, including any recovery action buttons.

## 5. End-to-End Integration, Refinement & Comprehensive Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2, 22.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing, integrate all sync status and error handling components, and refine the overall user experience.
### Details:
Conduct full system integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between sync status indicators and error messages. Verify that indicators update correctly after an error is resolved or a recovery action is taken. Perform performance testing to ensure UI updates are responsive. Gather final user feedback and address any remaining bugs or UX issues to ensure a robust and intuitive sync experience.
