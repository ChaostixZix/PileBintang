Completed error handling, cancellation, and finalized state UI:

Chat Component Enhancements:
- Added error state management with setError/error state
- Added canCancel state for showing/hiding cancel button
- Enhanced onSubmit with try/catch error handling and proper cleanup
- Added onCancelAI function for cancelling AI requests
- Added error message UI display with dismissible error banner
- Enhanced onResetConversation to clear error state
- Added conditional Cancel AI button in header (replaces Clear chat when streaming)

Editor Component Enhancements:
- Added canCancelAI state for tracking cancellation availability
- Enhanced generateAiResponse with better error messages showing actual error details
- Added cancelAiResponse function with proper cleanup and user feedback
- Improved error notifications to show specific error messages instead of generic "AI request failed"
- Added proper state management for cancellation throughout AI response lifecycle

Both components now properly handle Gemini streaming errors, provide cancellation capabilities, and show appropriate UI feedback for all states (streaming, error, completion, cancellation).
